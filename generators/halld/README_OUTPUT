bggen is the hall d photoproduction code I imported for SoLID background simulations. I have already generated set of standard LUND files for targets in SoLID and MOLLER experiments. 

Output LUND files are kept in,
/work/halla/solid/rakithab/halld/lund_format
These are generated by using scripts/HallD_LH_xs.cc and output from the bggen generator.

Set of output root files generated by bggen are also kept in,
/work/halla/solid/rakithab/halld/halld_rootfiles

for PVDIS H and D, SIDIS 3He ,
set1               bggen_output_1M_*.root
set2 to 5          bggen_set*_output_1M_*.root

for moller
set1               bggen_set1_output_MOLLER_1M_*.root

for J/psi
set1               bggen_output_Jpsi_1M_*.root

These are paw ntuples converted to ROOT TTrees using h2root executable.
